A masked service is one whose unit file is a symlink to /dev/null. This makes it "impossible" to load the service, even if it is required by another, enabled service.

When you mask a service, a symlink is created from /etc/systemd/system to /dev/null, leaving the original unit file elsewhere untouched. When you unmask a service the symlink is deleted.
